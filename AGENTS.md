# AGENTS.md

Invariants and conventions an agent cannot infer from a single file. `README.md` owns the product, dev setup, the generated native projects and EAS release, and is not repeated here.

## Commands

```sh
npm test                                  # node --test over lib/core/*.test.ts — no framework in the tree
node --test lib/core/market-logic.test.ts # one file
node --test --test-name-pattern="parses D/M/YYYY" lib/core/market-logic.test.ts   # one test
npm run typecheck                         # both TS programs: the app, then lib/core
npm run e2e                               # maestro test against a running dev build
npm run screenshots:ios                   # capture store screenshots (iOS)
npm run screenshots:android               # capture store screenshots (Android)
```

Those two are the whole of CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`); there is no lint step. Screens are not unit-tested — verifying them means a device build, and notifications cannot be checked in a simulator.

## E2E (Maestro)

`e2e/flows/` holds Maestro YAML; `e2e/utils/` holds shared subflows. `e2e/screenshots/` holds store-screenshot capture flows. Local-only — not in CI.

- Install the CLI standalone (`brew tap mobile-dev-inc/tap && brew install maestro`); nothing goes in `package.json` dependencies. Requires Java 17+.
- Run against the standalone dev build (`com.sfdye.pasarguru.dev`): `APP_VARIANT=development npx expo run:ios --configuration Release` then `npm run e2e:ios`. Android: `--variant release` on an API ≤ 34 emulator.
- Flows target elements by `testID` (Maestro's `id:` selector), not by text — accessibility labels are localized. Add a `testID` to any new interactive element a flow needs to address.
- Notifications, deep-link routing, and background refresh remain untestable in simulators.
- Before marking a PR ready for review, prompt the user to run `npm run e2e:ios` and `npm run e2e:android` locally against a fresh dev build.
- `e2e/screenshots/` produces 5 screenshots per locale (Discover, My Pasars, Market detail, Map, Settings). Re-capture after any UI or store-listing change. Capture flow: `npm run screenshots:ios` (iPhone) → `npm run screenshots:ios:ipad` (iPad, against iPad Pro 13-inch M4 simulator) → `npm run screenshots:copy` (copies from `.maestro/tests/` into `store/ios/screenshots/{en-US,zh-Hans}/{iphone,ipad}/`) → `npm run metadata:ios` (auto-resizes via `screenshots:resize:ios` then uploads). iPhone screenshots resize to 1242×2688 (6.5"), iPad screenshots to 2064×2752 (13" iPad Pro M4). Maestro captures at the simulator's native resolution, which may not match any ASC-supported size. `metadata:ios` uploads with `--replace` so uploads are idempotent — all remote screenshots are deleted before uploading, no duplicates.
- A Release build embeds JS at build time — the installed binary carries stale code until you rebuild. Always run `APP_VARIANT=development npx expo run:ios --configuration Release` before capturing screenshots or running e2e. Kill Metro first (`lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9`) so Maestro launches the standalone binary, not Metro-served JS.
- `expo run:ios` installs only on the simulator it launches — a Maestro flow "passing" on another simulator only proves *some* build is installed there. Before the iPad capture, `xcrun simctl uninstall <udid> com.sfdye.pasarguru.dev` then `simctl install` the fresh `DerivedData/PasarGuruDev-*/Build/Products/Release-iphonesimulator/PasarGuruDev.app` on the iPad sim — uninstall, don't just install over: a leftover app can OTA-pull stale JS from the `development` channel on launch (a 2026-09 iPad capture shipped old zh copy this way).

## Editing across the two TypeScript programs

`lib/core/` is typed against Node's globals and *not* React Native's, so an accidental `react-native` or `lib/` import fails typecheck rather than at runtime on device. That boundary constrains edits:

- Inside `lib/core/`, imports carry explicit `.ts` specifiers (`./market-logic.ts`) so `node --test` can strip types and run the files directly. Everywhere else, no extension.
- `lib/core/` must stay erasable-syntax-only: no enums, no namespaces, no parameter properties, and type-only imports marked `import type`.
- New logic worth unit-testing belongs in `lib/core/`; anything touching a device API cannot go there.
- Do not add an `include` entry to `tsconfig.json` — `expo start` rewrites that file, comments and all, when `include` names something it did not put there.

## Builds

- `app.json` is the base config and the only place plugin config belongs. `app.config.ts` layers the dev variant over it (`.dev` ids, "PasarGuru Dev") when `APP_VARIANT=development`, which the `npm run` scripts and the EAS `development` profile set — so a release build is the one that sets nothing. Keep `slug` and `extra.eas.projectId` out of the override.
- The build number is two keys in `app.json` — `ios.buildNumber` (a string) and `android.versionCode` (a number) — which must stay equal. Bump only with `npm run release`; never by hand, and never re-add `autoIncrement`.
- `production` is the TestFlight profile; TestFlight and the App Store take the same binary. Do not add a `testflight` profile or Expo's `preview` variant — the `apk` profile already covers internal testing.
- EAS Update ships JS/assets over the air (translations, `zh-names` fixes). `runtimeVersion` policy `appVersion` makes the per-release `version` bump the OTA boundary; `production` carries `channel: "production"`, inherited by `apk`. `eas update` bundles the **working tree** (unlike `eas build`), so publish from a clean tree. Native deps, SDK upgrades, and `app.json` native config still need a store build. README's OTA section has the commands.
- Branch config on `APP_VARIANT`, never `EAS_BUILD_PROFILE` — a local `expo run:ios` doesn't set the latter and would silently take the production branch.
- A Debug build embeds no JS (`SKIP_BUNDLING=1`) and is dead without Metro. `APP_VARIANT=development npx expo run:ios --configuration Release` gives a standalone dev app with no new EAS profile. Judge performance only on Release builds.
- `distribution: internal` ad-hoc signs for registered UDIDs; `production` provisions no devices and is TestFlight-only, not sideloadable.
- Every icon raster in `assets/` is **generated**: `npm run icons` derives them from `brand/` (Pillow + librsvg, hand-run). Edit the master in `brand/`, never the output. The 96px notification glyph is the exception — a hand-drawn SVG. `onemap-logo.png` and `app-store-badge.svg` are third-party compliance/licence artwork (OneMap, Apple), not generated.

## Store metadata (asc for iOS, fastlane for Android)

EAS keeps builds, binary submission, and OTA. iOS App Store state (metadata text, screenshots, categories, copyright, review notes, Accessibility Nutrition Labels) is pushed by `scripts/store-ios.mjs` through the `asc` CLI — fastlane/deliver cannot manage accessibility declarations. Android stays on fastlane `supply`; `asc` deliberately has no Android support.

- `npm run metadata:ios` / `metadata:android` — push listing state (no binary). iOS replaces stale screenshots; the push is dry-run-able with `metadata:ios:dry-run`.
- `npm run metadata:pull:ios` / `metadata:pull:android` — re-sync after dashboard edits; skip this and a later push overwrites your manual changes.
- iOS listing lives in `store/ios/`: `metadata/` is asc's JSON layout (`app-info/` is app-level, `version/<version>/` is per store version — when bumping `version` by hand, `git mv` the existing `version/` dir to match; the dir is singular, unlike asc's docs); `screenshots/{en-US,zh-Hans}/{iphone,ipad}/`. Android in `fastlane/metadata/android/{en-US,zh-CN}/` — note the different locale codes for Simplified Chinese.
- The Accessibility Nutrition Label (`A11Y` const in `store-ios.mjs`) declares VoiceOver, Larger Text, Dark Interface, Differentiate Without Color Alone, Sufficient Contrast, and Reduced Motion for iPhone + iPad. Apple's bar is "all common tasks completable with the feature" — re-verify with a VoiceOver pass on a device (never the simulator: it has no VO runtime) before adding a claim. Contrast lives in the palette (`statusOnWarn` exists because the bright warn/soon fills fail AA with white text).
- Play feature graphic and 512px icon are derived from `brand/icon-master-1024.png` (Pillow), not hand-drawn — regenerate if the mark changes.
- Credentials (gitignored): ASC API key JSON at `store/ios/asc-api-key.json` (`key_id`, `issuer_id`, `key` — derived from the `.p8` in `~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/`; `store-ios.mjs` exports them as `ASC_*` env, no `asc auth login` needed); Play service account JSON at `fastlane/play-service-account.json`. Reuse the Play key from EAS Submit credentials.
- Manual, outside both tools: App Store review contact details, country availability, and the Play category and privacy-policy URL (Play Console).

## State: an external store, not context

`lib/store/` is a hand-rolled external store read through `useSyncExternalStore`. Import from the barrel `lib/store`.

- `state.ts` owns the single `State` object plus `getState`/`subscribe`/`setState`. `setState` derives `lang` from `langPref` and `t` from `lang`, excluding both from its patch type; `t` is a stable per-language reference components memoise on.
- `hooks.ts` exposes one hook per slice. Subscribe to the narrowest one — `useIsFavorite(name)` exists so a star tap re-renders one row instead of all picker rows.
- `actions.ts` owns every side effect: persistence, the NEA fetch, the SGT-midnight timer, the `AppState` foreground listener, and `watchSchedule()`. `initStore()` is called once from `app/_layout.tsx` and is idempotent (Fast Refresh and StrictMode both call it twice).
- Rescheduling notifications is a **store subscriber**, not a React effect, so it runs when no screen is mounted. It debounces and dedupes on `lang|favorites|markets.length|remindersEnabled`.
- `mapView` is the persisted last camera position. `MarketMap` reads it once at mount (never subscribes — a re-render would re-serialise the tile style and all market features), saves user-initiated settles after a 500ms wait (a following `ConstrainedCamera` correction saves the final camera), retains in-progress pans for app backgrounding, and ignores MapLibre's non-user events, which can report a default camera. `null` (first-ever visit) means default to the user's current location. Validation lives in `parseMapView` (`lib/core/map-view.ts`).
- `themePref` (`'light'|'dark'|'system'`) follows the `langPref` pattern: `'system'` means the device decides. `useTheme` combines it with `useColorScheme()` via `resolveTheme` (`lib/core/theme-pref.ts`); no derivation in `setState` because the device scheme is a hook. Storage stores `'system'` as the key's absence. `app.json` `userInterfaceStyle` stays `"automatic"` — it governs native chrome, not the JS UI override.

Launch sequence: read AsyncStorage → `setState({ ready: true })`, which lifts the splash via `SplashGate` → revalidate over the network only if the cache is older than 24 hours.

## Timezone model

Status is a *civil date* question, so the app never mixes instants with calendar days:

- `sgToday()` returns a `Date` whose **local** Y/M/D match Singapore's. Pass these civil dates around, not `new Date()`.
- `sgInstant(civil, hour)` converts a civil date plus an SGT hour into a real instant — what a notification trigger needs. SGT is hardcoded UTC+8.
- Add days with `new Date(y, m, d + i)`, never `+ 86400000` — fixed milliseconds can shift the calendar day across a DST boundary in the *device's* timezone.
- `lib/date.ts` is display formatting only, hand-rolled rather than `Intl.DateTimeFormat` because Hermes on Android depends on device ICU data.

## Notifications

`lib/core/reminder-schedule.ts` builds the schedule purely (`buildSchedule`); `lib/notifications.ts` hands it to expo-notifications. Closures are grouped one entry per date (five favourites closing the same day → one notification), and each date gets two reminders: 7pm the evening before, 6am the morning of. Closures ≤ `LONG_CLOSURE_DAYS` (7) expand to daily pairs; longer closures notify only on their genuine first day — probed by checking whether the previous day was also closed, since `getUpcomingClosures` starts scanning tomorrow and would otherwise manufacture a fresh "first day" every rebuild. `getUpcomingClosures` returns only verified closures (cleaning, other works) — Monday warnings are excluded at the source, so reminders and the upcoming-closures list never contain them.

iOS silently keeps only the ~64 soonest pending requests, so `rescheduleAll` caps at 56 and cancels-then-rebuilds every time; the daily background task (`lib/background.ts`) tops the queue up as near ones fire. Background refresh is best-effort — cold-start rescheduling in the store is the reliable path, not the task.

## Handing a market to a map app

Tapping the address opens Apple Maps or Google Maps; the setting is iOS-only (Android's `geo:` hand-off already uses the user's default).

- `lib/core/map-provider.ts` is pure: `resolveMapProvider(pref, installed)` and `mapUrl`. `lib/maps.ts` supplies `Platform.OS` and the `canOpenURL` probes.
- Stored preference is `MapProvider | 'auto'`; `'auto'` resolves to Google Maps when installed, else Apple Maps. The Apple probe is hardcoded `true` — iOS keeps `maps://` registered even when the app is "deleted", so `canOpenURL` can't detect it. Which apps are installed is *not* app state: `openInMaps` probes at tap time; Settings uses `useMapProvider(pref)`, which returns `null` while probing.
- `canOpenURL` answers false for schemes not in `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` (`app.json`), so `comgooglemaps` is listed there — dropping it silently turns "installed" into "missing". Adding a third map app means adding its scheme.

## UI conventions

- `components/ui/` is the primitive layer (`Text`, `Button`, `Card`, `Row`, `Notice`, `Segmented`, `EmptyState`, `Fab`, `Icon`), imported from `components/ui`.
- Use `Text` from `components/ui`, never `react-native`'s. Pick a `variant` and a `tone`, not raw `fontSize`/`color`. **Never cap `maxFontSizeMultiplier`** on body copy — the audience is seniors and Dynamic Type must work at every size.
- Colours and spacing come from `lib/theme` (`space`, `radius`, `HIT_SIZE`, `useTheme`). In dark mode `theme.shadow` is a hairline border — a shadow is invisible against black.
- `useThemedStyles(factory)` memoises on the factory, so **declare the factory at module scope**.
- `Fab` places itself against the tab bar: mount it as the last child of a `flex: 1` container on a tab screen and add `FAB_CLEARANCE` to the scrolling child's `contentContainerStyle`. Do not add `useSafeAreaInsets`/tab-bar-height padding — the screen box already ends at the tab bar's top edge.
- Today rows switch to a compact text hierarchy past `COMPACT_FONT_SCALE` (1.4). Read the scale reactively with `useWindowDimensions().fontScale`, never `PixelRatio.getFontScale()` at render.
- Anything tappable inside a gesture takes `Pressable` from the gesture wrapper (`SwipeToDeleteRow` re-exports it), never from `react-native`.
- The back button is a bare chevron everywhere via `headerBackButtonDisplayMode: 'minimal'` on the root `<Stack>`; a new nested `Stack` that pushes screens must repeat it — `screenOptions` don't reach nested navigators.
- One `ThemeProvider` at the root themes the native chrome. react-navigation is vendored inside expo-router 57 — import from `expo-router`; there is no `@react-navigation/*` package. Leave tab bar labels to the default; a custom `tabBarLabel` bypasses iOS's fixed-height bar behaviour.
- `SettingsSection` takes an optional `icon` (`IconName`) rendered beside the overline title. Settings is a hub of chevron rows pushing sub-pages (`language`, `appearance`, `maps`, `about`) in the settings `Stack`.

### Map (MapLibre + OneMap)

- Tiles end at `SG_BOUNDS` (`lib/core/map-bounds.ts`). The raster source's `bounds` only stops requests, so OneMap still serves non-PNG boundary tiles that MapLibre logs as errors — silenced in dev by `configureMapLogging()` (`lib/maplibre.ts`), called at module scope from `MarketMap` to keep MapLibre out of cold start.
- Dark mode swaps the Default tileset for OneMap's Night variant; bounds, zoom range, and attribution are identical for both.
- `ConstrainedCamera` keeps empty background unreachable: `maxBounds` gets `SG_BOUNDS` inset by half the viewport span, and `constrain()` eases the centre back after an outgrowing zoom-out. A reported centre outside `SG_BOUNDS` is startup garbage — ignore it, don't clamp it. Keep its state in that component; a settle in `MarketMap` would re-serialise the tile style and all features.
- Initial view priority: saved `mapView` → user's current location (first visit, via `awaitingFix`) → Singapore overview.
- `MapAttribution` (the OneMap logo + © SLA pill, bottom-left) is required by OneMap's Terms of Use — don't remove it or hide the native attribution behind it. The `attribution={false}` on `Map` is deliberate: the overlay replaces the text-only native button with the logo the licence demands.

## i18n

`lib/i18n.ts` holds two flat objects. `en` is the source of truth (`StringKey = keyof typeof en`) and `zh` is typed `Record<keyof typeof en, string>`, so a missing translation fails typecheck. Get `t` from `useT()`; interpolate with `{name}` placeholders. Market names have a separate Chinese lookup in `lib/core/zh-names.ts`, keyed by the *friendly* (parenthesised) part of the NEA name — reach it through `getDisplayName`/`displayName` so notifications aren't half-translated.

Closure reasons are worded once, in `lib/core/reason-words.ts` (in core because `notificationCopy` is there), and read back by `i18n.ts` for the status pill. Word a new reason there, not at the call site.

Famous-pasar blurbs follow the same pattern: `lib/core/famous.ts` holds `FAMOUS_PASARS` (ordered by editorial rank) with a `Record<Lang, string>` blurb per entry — both languages in core so a missing translation fails typecheck. Keys are the *friendly* name as it appears in the NEA dataset (verified against the live API), not the common name.

Language resolution: `state.langPref` (`Lang | 'system'`) is the choice, `lang` follows from it, resolved through `lib/lang.ts` (separate module so headless `background.ts` can reach it without the store). Three rules: a missing `pg_lang` means `'system'` (`loadLangPref` returns it rather than `null` — `?? 'en'` once sent English reminders to Chinese phones); membership of the supported set is `isLang()`, never `=== 'en' || === 'zh'`; re-passing an unchanged `langPref` to `setState` re-resolves deliberately (that's how foreground picks up a device-language change).

## Dataset handling

- Market identity is the raw NEA `name` string; favourites are stored as those strings. `parseMarketName` splits `"Blk 1 Foo Rd (Bar Market)"` into street plus friendly name and decodes HTML entities.
- `normalizeMarkets` runs at every ingress — network fetch *and* cache read. Dataset quirk fixes belong there.
- Some NEA friendly names don't match common usage ("Kim Hua Market" for Maxwell, "Telok Ayer Food Centre" for Amoy). The fix is display-only via `lib/core/name-overrides.ts`, consulted by `getDisplayName` — the raw `name` string (identity) is never rewritten.
- A market can leave the dataset: favourites pointing at a missing market are pruned on load, and `useMarket` returns `null`. Handle that in any new screen.
- `MAX_FAVORITES` (`lib/core/favorites.ts`) caps the list; it's a reminder-queue bound alongside `HORIZON_DAYS` and `MAX_SCHEDULED_REMINDERS`, and `reminder-schedule.test.ts` asserts a full list still fits. Enforcement is at the add only; removal always works. `toggleFavorite` raises the limit Alert itself.
- `fetchMarketsFromAPI` returns `null` rather than throwing (10s timeout, one retry); the caller falls back to the cache and sets `stale`.
- AsyncStorage keys are namespaced `pg_`.
- One NEA row = one closure schedule = one notification source = one favourite. Do not merge rows that are separate blocks (even if same complex — NEA describes them as "standalone" with different addresses) or split combined rows (one building, one schedule). Preserve the dataset's row structure.
- Discover wet/food filter is presence-based, not ratio-based (`getMarketCategories` in `lib/core/market-category.ts`): any row with market stalls appears under "wet", any with food stalls under "food". A combined centre shows in both.
